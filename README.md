Doing the Advent Of Code 2024

First 3 day are done in C# to learn the language
The remaining days are in Python to improve my skills

Interesting notes about learning points / challenge / thoughts about each days:

- Day01 => Implementing an indexer and a custom `defaultDict` in C#
- Day02 => Clean and easy to code solution, but time complexity is not optimal
- Day03 => Regex in C#
- Day04 => Array matrixes diagonals manipulation black magic
- D04p2 => Using ASCII values to ignore directions
- Day05 => Use of a HashMap for every rule, keeping an update slice of prev-next of our current update: allow to never check the rules in more than one direction
- Day06 => In my first iteration I rotated the whole map instead of the guard, GoogleMap style
- D06p2 => Time optimisation -> checking for loops only for part1 elems | triggering loop if we visited same place at same direction
- Day07 => Comprehensions order in python are not intuitive
- Day08 => Some interesting recursivity
